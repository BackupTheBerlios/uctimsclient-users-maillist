<PRE>Hey everyone,

I have a question about how &quot;compliant&quot; the IPTV Indirection Server
actually is. I've been messing with the source, and I noticed that it
simply puts the indirected URL in the response header. I know the
website says it is an attempt at compliancy, but is there any RFC, or
other such documentation that says that this is indeed the way things
should be done?

I ask this because there are several telco's that are seriously looking
at moving to IMS, and one of the big selling points for them is
indirected content such as IPTV channels, as well as Video On Demand.
The UCT's previous IPTV solution (where the video is streamed as a Video
Conference), seems more compatible to me, as it could potentially be
consumed by any IMS Client capable of video conferencing. The new
method, whereby RTSP content is handed off to libvlc, seems like it is
just adding a new layer to the IMS client that most other clients (if
not all) won't have.

If anyone knows any details about this, I would be very interested to
hear them!
