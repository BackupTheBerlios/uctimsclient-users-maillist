<PRE>Hi,

The approach used by the IPTv indirection server is based on RFC 4483 
that describes a mechanism for content indirection in SIP messages.  We 
use the libvlc library to deal with the RTSP functionality, but any 
client that supports SIP content indirection (as specified in RFC 4483) 
and RTSP should theoretically be able to work with the Indirection 
server and appropriate media server.

The previous IPTv server simply added each client to the broadcast IPTv 
stream that they requested.  With a little bit of tweaking this could 
support VoD as well as broadcast, but none of the RTSP trick commands 
are supported nor is this approach specified in any standards. But it 
does work!

There are many many standards out there specifying IPTv - however I 
think the most comprehensive IMS approach right now is the ETSI TISPAN 
approach (see TS 183 063 and TS 182 027). 

The UCT IPTv implementation is a first attempt at one of the many 
possible approaches.

Regards,
Richard.
