<PRE>Dave

 

 I have been trying to make end-to-end voice call by using UCTIMSCleint and
FOKUS. 

 

 My setup looks like this, 

 

1.       Linux Fedora Core (machine 1) --- Fokus is setup including FHoSS

 

2.       Linux Fedora Core (machine 2)--- one UCTIMSClient , it has got
Intel-had-snd card with chipset 8280 1G (ICH 7 family), with the device
being to STAC92XX analog.  Local sound card verification works fine. 

  

3.       Linux Fedora Core (machine 3)--- one other UCTIMSClient , it has
got Intel-had-snd card with chipset 8280 1G (ICH 7 family), with the device
being to STAC92XX analog.  Local sound card verification works fine.

 

Since both the UCTIMS clients are registered with FHOSS, I am making a call
from one to the other, wherein the called party gets to hear ringback played
locally, But when the called clientanswers the incoming call, both the
UCTIMSClients are displaying &quot;Call is established&quot;. However I don't see any
audio packets (RTP) flowing through between them. 

 

 

For your reference, this is what I see on both the UCTIMSClients console, 

 

lsa_set_params: The period size 256 is not supported by your hardware.

 ==&gt; Using 256 instead.

alsa_set_params: The period size 256 is not supported by your hardware.

 ==&gt; Using 255 instead.

alsa_set_params: The period size 1280 is not supported by your hardware.

 ==&gt; Using 1279 instead.

alsa_set_params: The number of periods 4 is not supported by your hardware.

 ==&gt; Using 2 instead.

alsa_set_params: The period size 256 is not supported by your hardware.

*        Using 256 instead.

 

Any help on this would be really helpful and appreciated. 

 

Thanks,

Gaurav Kansal
