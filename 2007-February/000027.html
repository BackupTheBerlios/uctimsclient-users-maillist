I monitored the traffic flowing from port 10001 using ethereal. It's always
UDP packets flowing from port 10001 from 10.0.64.16(the one which triggered
the INVITE i.e. calling party) to port 10001 on 10.0.64.18 (the called
party) after the call is established. There is no packet flowing from other
side.

 

I don't know if these are RTP packets as ethereal always shows the source
and destination port as following:

Source port: scp-config (10001)

Destination port: scp-config (10001)

 

Could you please suggest something?

 

Regards,

Gaurav Kansal

I know there are issues with some sound cards not working perfectly, but you
have a strange problem. The RTP packets should flow anyway.

Make sure you are capturing on port 10001 (the default client media port).
Typing tcpdump should verify that there are a large number of packets
flowing of length 172.

It's possible the client could not open your sound card at all and gave up.

 I have been trying to make end-to-end voice call by using UCTIMSCleint and
FOKUS. 

 

 My setup looks like this, 

 

1.       Linux Fedora Core (machine 1) --- Fokus is setup including FHoSS

 

2.       Linux Fedora Core (machine 2)--- one UCTIMSClient , it has got
Intel-had-snd card with chipset 8280 1G (ICH 7 family), with the device
being to STAC92XX analog.  Local sound card verification works fine. 

  

3.       Linux Fedora Core (machine 3)--- one other UCTIMSClient , it has
got Intel-had-snd card with chipset 8280 1G (ICH 7 family), with the device
being to STAC92XX analog.  Local sound card verification works fine.

 

Since both the UCTIMS clients are registered with FHOSS, I am making a call
from one to the other, wherein the called party gets to hear ringback played
locally, But when the called clientanswers the incoming call, both the
UCTIMSClients are displaying &quot;Call is established&quot;. However I don't see any
audio packets (RTP) flowing through between them. 

 

 

For your reference, this is what I see on both the UCTIMSClients console, 

 

lsa_set_params: The period size 256 is not supported by your hardware.

 ==&gt; Using 256 instead.

alsa_set_params: The period size 256 is not supported by your hardware.

 ==&gt; Using 255 instead.

alsa_set_params: The period size 1280 is not supported by your hardware.

 ==&gt; Using 1279 instead.

alsa_set_params: The number of periods 4 is not supported by your hardware.

 ==&gt; Using 2 instead.

alsa_set_params: The period size 256 is not supported by your hardware.

*        Using 256 instead.

 

Any help on this would be really helpful and appreciated. 

 

Thanks,

Gaurav Kansal
