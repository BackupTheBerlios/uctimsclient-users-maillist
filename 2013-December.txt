Subject: [Uctimsclient-users] blank window poped on callee client at a voice
	call
Message-ID: <CADcMG7=cEcn8Nt+0SEojD-Tj2cd8H5XR_SPRnEJjzzSON2yt6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm studying open IMS core and I built an IMS network on my ubuntu 12.04.
Then I compiled the uctimsclient1.0.14 with source code, copied the
executable file into to folders and run them respectively as Alice and Bob.
Registering is OKay. But when I make a call from Alice to Bob and after Bob
answer it, a blank window pops up on Bob's client and show nothing. I'm
sure that I the vedio is disabled.
Does anyone know what's going on?

Thanks
George
