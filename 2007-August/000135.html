<PRE>Hello!

We are currently testing the UCTIMSClient together with the Fraunhofer IMS Core and the Oracle OCMS as SIP application and especially as XCAP and presence server (so no openser bases presence server here!). Here are some experiences:

* Oracle uses a different path for the pres-rules on the XCAP server. While you use &quot;pres-rules/user&quot; Oracle uses &quot;pres-rules/users&quot;. Reading the relvant RFC it looks like Oracle is right. Since in priciple everybody may use the path that suits him, we would recomment to simply make this configurable :-)

* On the other hand Oracle currently only implements an earlier draft of RF 4745 which has a different syntax for &quot;pres-rules&quot; files (btw. it also names the files presrule sand not presence_rules.xml by default. Perhaps this should also be configurable).

* We are not sure, but is it possible that the application does not automatically deregister on close? Would be not nice :-/

* We currently have the problem (possibly because the clients does not automatically dregister on close) that a presence status sometimes contains more than one entry for one user/device combination. It seems that the UCTIMSClient in this case uses the last entry (last in the meaning of &quot;at the bottom&quot;) in the list. This has the consequence that the client sometimes shows an old status for an entry in the buddy list. We think that the behaviour is incorrect and the client should always use the latest (in the sence of &quot;most current regarding the given time stamp&quot;) entry.

* Finally: While we see that the client is not finished yet, we would still like to further use it for tests and similar (together with other clients). Can you tell us something about the background (goals? Is this a university project? roadmaps? timeframe? Do you actively use the Bug Tracker?) of the client development? Are you interested in bug reports (and of course what can we except regarding bug fixes :-)?)?
We would also politely ask if there is a repository for the current development code that we can access. Also while it is unlikely that we would activly participate in the devlopement it may be possible that we would like to send patches for bug fixes or enhancements in some cases (which would further motivate the question for a repository with the current development sources) - if they get applied and integrated. Can you make a statement about that, too?

P.S.: It seems like you release new version on a monthly basis. Will there be a new version soon ;-)?

Greetings...
 Tim
