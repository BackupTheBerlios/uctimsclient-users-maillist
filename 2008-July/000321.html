<PRE>Hi Khoirush

The IPtv server was written by a collegue Richard Spiers and he might have
some more information on this so I am cc-ing this reply to the mailing list.

The media parts of the UCT IMS client and the IPtv server are all
implemented using the gStreamer libraries. These libraries handle the video
compression, packetisation and transmission of both the audio and video
media. As far as I know the video codec is the H.263 codec supplied by
gStreamer. I believe there are various versions of this codec so it is
possible that the Java version is not the same as the gStreamer version.

My suggestion would be to fiddle with the IPtv server code and change the
video codec to one of the others supported by gStreamer. The code is not too
complicated and generally the gStreamer parts are very easy to manipulate.
You will of course then need to change the SIP SDP negotiation to handle a
new codec.

Perhaps Richard has some more insight into this problem and further
suggestions.

Regards

Dave

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also have tried to use the JVLC application to stream the video, and

</I>&gt;<i> It also shows that the video is already fetched but it's just can't be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only reason that i can think right now is that the video data was

</I>&gt;<i> But that's only our hypothesis.
</I>&gt;<i> So could you give us some clue why the video can't be decoded and how to
</I>&gt;<i> decode the video packet ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ps: sorry for my bad english and my impolite manner, but we really need
</I>&gt;<i> help from the creator of the UCT IMS Client.
