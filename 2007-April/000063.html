<PRE>Vijay, 

 

As Dave rightly said, you can follow that approach.

 

In case if you still see the problem, let me know what your UCTIMSClient
preferences are. That will help me understand and then I can help you on
that.

 

Thanks,
Ramachandran Gunasekaran

Ramachandran solved the problem like this:


Actually if you configure P-CSCF address in UCTIMSClient as IP address, ACK
is a problem, which further leads to not initializing the RTP ports. In this
case, one way RTP packets are sent.

 

However if you configure P-CSCF address as domain in UCTIMSClient, for
example &quot;pcscf.open-ims.test:4060&quot;, ACK is sent properly and hence there is
a two way RTP.



It seems that the pcscf handles ACK differently and this causes a problem.

Hi Ramachandran,

 

We have a similar situation where I see only UDP (but not RTP inside)
packets go in one direction and also do not see the ACK going back to the
called UA. How did you get the calling UA to send the ACK? I would
appreciate if you could share your experience in resolving this issue.
Thanks,

 

Regards,

 

Vijay

Hi Ramachandran

Glad you managed to get everything working okay.

Hope the ACK problem was not a bug in the client?

Regards

Dave

Hi Dave, 
 
 Finally I have made uctimsclient working on ubuntu linux 6.10, with Intel
ICH2, sound card. This intel card is external non-HDA sound card. 
 
 There were some configuration issues present in the Signaling path, which
caused uctimsclient not sending the ACK message at all. So there was one way
RTP flow from the calling uctimsclient phone. But once the ACK signaling is
sent by uctimsclient, now there is two IMS voice call flow.
 
Thanks a lot for your kind support and patience.

Ramachandran Gunasekaran

There is no RTP packets flowing from UCTIMSClient, from ethereal traces I
could confirm that.

Hi
 
Did you confirm that the RTP packets are flowing okay?
 
We are using Ubuntu 6.10. I have a VIA Technologies, Inc. 
VT8233/A/8235/8237 AC97 Audio Controller.
 
The default alsa setup in the client works fine for my hardware setup.
 
I worked out why your previous emails got no reply. Your email server is 
blocking email from us, so I can only reply via the mailing list!
 
Regards
 
Dave

Hello David,
 
Thanks for your response.
 
Can you please tell me, on what hardware platform you have tested the 
basic voice call with UCTIMSClient? This is to replicate the same at 
my lab and test it once.
 
What is the operating system? Which vendors sound card present in your 
basic test setup? If possible please share the alsaconf on your system.
 
Thanks a lot in advance.
 
Regards,
 
Ramachandran

*Subject:* Media path is a problem with UCTIMSClient
 
Hi David and Richard,
 
I got both of your reference from media.c file of uctimsclient source 
base. Long back I posted this to uctimscleint mailing as well, so far 
nobody has replied to that.
 
I have installed uctimsclient and FOKUS IMS on FC 6.0 machines. These 
are physically separated like one machine having installed X-CSCF/HSS 
and other two identical machines having installed UCTIMSClient's.
 
I am able to get the phones registered with FOKUS X-CSXCF/HSS 
successfully, also the phone GUI says call is established. Whenever I 
make a call from one phone to other, I am able here the ringing sound 
properly, but the moment other phone answers the call, No sound at 
both the ends.
 
Can you please tell me, what should be the issue here? My FC machine 
has intel-had-snd cards with ensonique chitpset. For some reason there 
is no audio flowing between these two phones.
 
Expecting a favorable response from both of you.
 
Thanks,
 
Ramachandran
