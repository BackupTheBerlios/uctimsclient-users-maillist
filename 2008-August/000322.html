Hi,

There has been some confusion regarding the IPtv software packages under 
development as part of the UCT IMS Client project.

To clarify:

The UCT IPtv Streaming Server released under the package name &quot;UCT IPtv 
Server&quot;,  is a streaming server implementation based on the gstreamer 
framework that allows broadcast video over an IMS network.  This 
implementation is not standards based and is no longer under active 
development.  However it is useful for IMS demos and for network stress 
testing, and is a complete server and client solution, so it is still 
operational.

UCT Advanced IPtv involves an Indirection Application Server and any 3rd 
party RTSP enabled media server (e.g. Darwin or VLC).  This was 
initially released as version 1.0.3 under the package &quot;UCT IPtv Server&quot;, 
but to prevent confusion it has now been moved to a new package: &quot;UCT 
IPtv Advanced&quot;.  (Only the package and naming details have changed, not 
the actual source code).  This is a more comprehensive and standards 
based approach to IMS IPtv and allows VoD and broadcast streaming, but does require a 
3rd party media server.  A more comprehensive How To including the setup 
of a 3rd party media server has been posted to the website.

Regards,
Richard.
