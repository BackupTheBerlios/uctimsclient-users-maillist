<PRE>Hi Khaldon,
 
&gt;<i> Audio Call
</I>&gt;<i> If I make a call from Xlite to UCT Client, both phones are ringing but it
</I>&gt;<i> fails when I answer(in the UCT client part). The Xlite displays &quot;Call
</I>&gt;<i> failed. Media negociation failed&quot;. So I directly went to the audio/video
</I>&gt;<i> codec menu to check whether they were the same on both side. But That did
</I>&gt;<i> not change anything. Attached is the wireshark trace (xlite2uctimscall).
</I>
I have looked at your trace and found that the main problem is the forking
issue, which is well known (the CANCEL is generated autonomously by the SER
part in this case and does not comply with IMS). See packets 85 and 86.

&gt;<i> If I make a call from UCT Client to Xlite, both phone are ringing and the
</I>&gt;<i> communication is established. But the only thing we can hear on both side
</I>&gt;<i> is a big noise! (Exactly the same when I used the UCTB2BUA...). Attached
</I>&gt;<i> is the wireshark trace(uctims2xlitecall).
</I>
In this case the problem is at the client side (two clients at on machine):
One client detects a merged request (482 Merged Request, packet 35, 36).

A brief summary to your tests between XLite and UCTIMS -  and to my
experience is the following:
- Forking does not work because of the CANCEL issue
- If you make tests without forking you have two situations:
  - Call from XLite to UCTIMS works
  - Call from UCTIMS to XLITE does not work because of &quot;Require:
precondition) which is not supported by XLite.

&gt;<i> Instant Messaging
</I>&gt;<i> If I write a message from UCT client to Xlite, everything works
</I>&gt;<i> well.Attached is the wireshark trace(xlite2uctimsIM).
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> But that is not working from Xlite to UCT Client. Xlite receives a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;REQUEST TIME OUT&quot;.I do not why the UCTIMS client does not respond with a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;200 OK&quot; when it receives the a  &quot;MESSAGE&quot;.Attached is the wireshark
</I>&gt;<i> trace(uctims2xliteIM).
</I>
I see that the UAS (bob) does not respond to the MESSAGE, but cannot say
why? Is there any log of the client?

I attach all szenario-files which I have created to quickly see what
happens.

Regards
Franz
