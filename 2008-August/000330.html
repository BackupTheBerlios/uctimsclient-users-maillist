<PRE>Hi Kaldon,

Firstly thanks for carrying out these interoperability tests.

I have tried with XLite 3.0 (On Windows only) and XLite 2.0 (on Linux) 
and have so far failed to register with the IMS Core.  Each time Xlite 
fails on receipt of the 401 Challenge response.  I'm not sure if this is 
something I am configuring incorrectly.

So I have not been able to reproduce your tests yet, but can try as far 
as possible to explain the signaling dumps.

UCTIMS2XliteCall:

 From what I can gather XLite on receipt of the INVITE request issues a 
482 Merge Request - From SIP RFC:

8.2.2.2 Merged Requests

   If the request has no tag in the To header field, the UAS core MUST
   check the request against ongoing transactions.  If the From tag,
   Call-ID, and CSeq exactly match those associated with an ongoing
   transaction, but the request does not match that transaction (based
   on the matching rules in Section 17.2.3), the UAS core SHOULD
   generate a 482 (Loop Detected) response and pass it to the server
   transaction.


I can't see why XLite would issue this request.  XLite then issues 180 
ringing response, followed by 200 OK (call answered) - which UCT IMS 
Client ACKs.  Again I am not too sure why the RTP doesn't flow.  This 
could be an issue related to the Merge request or your sound card (Can 
you make calls successfully between two UCT IMS Clients and between two 
XLite clients?  This will ensure that both clients have detected your 
sound card successfully)

XLite2UCTIMSCall:
This signaling is tricky to understand.
XLite sends an INVITE, UCT IMS Client responds with 180 ringing and then 
200 OK (when call is answered) .  The S-CSCF then issues a CANCEL 
request to which the P-CSCF responds with a 403 not registered (???).  
The 200 OK is still conveyed to XLite, there are then NOTIFY, 481 
Subscription Does not exist  and 400 Bad Request messages, however Xlite 
does not send the final ACK message.  It almost seems as though some of 
the signaling has been removed (???) Please can you reperform this test 
and resubmit the signaling.

Xlite2UCTIMSIM:
Here Xlite sends SIP Message methods to the UCT IMS Client. 
However all of these messages are indication of composition messages 
(i.e. messages that say the other user is typing, etc.) and none 
actually contain any text data.  I don't think you need to 200 OK these 
notification messages though I see XLite does from the other signaling 
example.
In the UCT IMS Client you should get a message saying &quot;Some one is 
typing&quot; with a little pencil in the top right corner of the IM window as 
notification.  If you type in an instant message from Xlite and send, 
the SIP Message method should contain text data.  If a SIP Message is 
received with text data the UCT IMS Client will respond with a 200 OK 
and display that text.

Xlite is a pure SIP client not made to support full IMS signaling which 
could be the cause of some of the interoperability issues.  
Interoperability tests between the UCT IMS Client, the Open IC Lite and 
the IMS Communicator will yield better results.

Regards,
Richard.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     First of all, I wanted to know if UCT IMS client handles MD5

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     directly went to the audio/video codec menu to check whether they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     were the same on both side. But That did not change anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Attached is the wireshark trace (xlite2uctimscall).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If I make a call from UCT Client to Xlite, both phone are ringing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and the communication is established. But the only thing we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     hear on both side is a big noise! (Exactly the same when I used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the UCTB2BUA...). Attached is the wireshark trace(uctims2xlitecall).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Instant Messaging
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If I write a message from UCT client to Xlite, everything works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     well.Attached is the wireshark trace(xlite2uctimsIM).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     But that is not working from Xlite to UCT Client. Xlite receives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     a &quot;REQUEST TIME OUT&quot;.I do not why the UCTIMS client does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     respond with a &quot;200 OK&quot; when it receives the a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;MESSAGE&quot;.Attached is the wireshark trace(uctims2xliteIM).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     That would be great if anyone of you could explain thoses issues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (maybe bugs...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
