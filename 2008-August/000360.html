<PRE>Hi Richard,
 
Thanks for the response.
 
I was getting the below Error [Thread-4] ERROR
de.fhg.fokus.diameter.DiameterPeer.peer.StateMachine  - StateMachine:
Peer pcrf.open-ims.test not responding to connection attempt as you
mentioned. But now it seems to be corrected as both the PCEF and PCRF is
running.
Instead I am getting the following Exception:
 
java.lang.Exception:Read failed
     at
de.fhg.fokus.diameter.DiameterPeer.transport.Communicator.run(Communicat
or.jav:187)
 
I have also modified the DiameterPeerXXX.xml files in the config folder
to change to my domain name and IP address.
 
Pl help on this.
 
And, also pl let me know how will I test whether the PCRF and PCEF is
running and communicating and both the Rx/Gx interface is up.
 
Thanks &amp; Regards,
Indranil

Hi,

Is that the exact error message - or is it more like:

[Thread-4] ERROR de.fhg.fokus.diameter.DiameterPeer.peer.StateMachine  -
StateMachine: Peer pcrf.open-ims.test not responding to connection
attempt 

If this is the case and the error does not persist there is no problem.
This message will appear if the Diameter peer (This case the PCRF) is
not yet running.  Once you run the PCRF this error should not appear
again.

If this is not your problem - have you correctly modified the
DiameterPeerXXX.xml files in the config folder to change your domain
name and IP address?

Regards,
Richard.
