<PRE>Hi Peeyush,

&gt;<i> Yes I have ims setup ready all i-cscf, p-cscf, s-cscf on the same machine
</I>&gt;<i> where I have installed the HSS server.
</I>
&gt;<i> Can anyone kindly tell the step-by-step procedure of setting up a chat
</I>&gt;<i> session between 2 machines using UCTIMSClient, I want to install
</I>&gt;<i> uctimsclient on 2 machines and I want 3rd machine to be HSS server which
</I>&gt;<i> would validate the credentials of those clients  and then allow the
</I>&gt;<i> communication between them
</I>
Thats a big question. You have tro be more specific.
Did you follow the guide <A HREF="http://www.openimscore.org/installation_guide?">http://www.openimscore.org/installation_guide?</A>
Maybe you are now at step 7.

Just follow the instructions.
I do not have much experience with UCTIMS client. Maybe you also should start using the Monster client.

BR and good luck
Franz
