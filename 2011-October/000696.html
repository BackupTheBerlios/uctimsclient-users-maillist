<PRE>Sorry for the barrage of emails.
Can anyone share the wireshark traces for the tests shown in Richard Good's paper (Step 7).

Using the UCT IMS Client try and set up a call with 
						the QoS field in the Profile menu set to 
						&quot;mandatory&quot;. This ensures that preconditions are 
						mandatory and that full IMS session initiation will take 
						place including exchange of SDP offers and answers.
						Examine the PCRF terminal window - with&#160; each 
						exchange of SDP offer and answer a Diameter request is 
						sent to the PCRF.&#160; This request contains service 
						information; based on pre-stored domain policies a 
						decision is made whether or not to allow the session to 
						continue - a enforcement policy rule for the session is created. 
						Also note that bandwidth has been been deducted from the 
						relevant QoS Classes and Domains to serve the session.
						Using the Web Management Interface view the Dynamic 
						policies and note that dynamic IMS Sessions and 
						associated IP Flows rules have been created. When the session is 
						cancelled/ended a Diameter termination request is sent 
						(examine the PCRF terminal window), the dynamic IMS 
						session and IP Flows are removed and bandwidth etc. is 
						returned to the relevant QoS Classes and Domains.
						Using the Web Interface edit the domain policies 
						and remove a codec that is needed for the session - note 
						that now when a session is setup the call is rejected 
						based on policies.&#160; A call can also be rejected 
						because of insufficient bandwidth, unauthorised domains, 
						unauthorised QoS classes, etc.
						The PCEF controls a DiffServ router that that defines 
						several different levels of services, based on the 
						enforcement rule packets are allowed, marked and queued 
						accordingly - if you monitor the individual 
						packets during a media session you can see the different DSCP field values assigned for different QoS levels. (Note:
						CONVERSATIONAL and STREAMING classes are marked as 
						EF streams, while INTERACTIVE and BACKGROUND are marked 
						as BE streams)
						Additionally PCEF performs QoS/bandwidth monitoring, 
						calculates usage statistics and detects transport layer 
						events. A thread is created for each added IP Flow that 
						monitors the bandwidth usage of that thread. To use this you must have an RTP Proxy 
						enabled and enable the data counter through the 
						Administration Tab of the Web Interface.&#160; If QoS 
						monitoring is enabled flow information is written to a 
						log file under /opt/OpenIMSCore/uctprcf/reports/qos_report_logs. 
						Establish and terminate a few sessions and examine the 
						QoS report logs, note that each time a flow is removed 
						from IP Tables it is recorded in the logs.
						Now set up a call between two client and cause one of 
						the clients to crash (CTRL-C). The 
						bandwidth monitor will detect this LOSS OF BEARER and 
						trigger an event that will remove the dynamic policy 
						rules at the PCRF and cause the P-CSCF to terminate the 
						call with the remaining client.
						Note there are 2 config files for the PCSCF operation 
						- pcscf.qos.cfg and pcscf.qos.rtp.cfg. The 
						first config file should be used when you are not 
						running an RTP proxy and have a single IMS domain; here 
						resource reservation is only performed at the 
						originating side (both originating and terminating are 
						the same) so as not to complicate matters with redundant 
						Diameter messages.&#160; If you have an RTP proxy 
						running you will want to perform resource reservation on 
						both the terminating and originating side and should use 
						the pcscf.qos.rtp.cfg config file.


thx

Folks,
I am trying to install the whole set of applications from UCT - IMS client, IMS charging framework, pcrf etc.Does this work only on Ubuntu Linux release or can I also run it on Fedora. I am currently on Core 6 version.
Thanks,Vijayalakshmi
