<PRE>Hi Didier,

 

that means you succeeded with your installation?

I also experienced bugs in Rx interface not being aligned anymore between
OpenIMSCore and UCT IMS Policy Framework.

See:
<A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openimscore-users/2011-January/006797.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openimscore-users/2011-January/006797.html</A>


But the student was not able to dig deeper and propose some code
adaptations.

Franz

Hi there,

Just in case somebody has the same kind of problem than me, I found out that
branch 08 does not exists any more because it was replaced by branch 13
which is now included in the trunk version. Therefore, no need to install
branch 8 as specified in the &quot;howto&quot; page of UCT IMS Policy Framework. The
latest version of ser_ims does include everything you need to work with UCT
IMS policy Framework.
Simply copy your pcscf.cfg as pcscf.qos.cfg and uncomment the following
lines :
 
loadmodule &quot;/opt/OpenIMSCore/ser_ims/modules/cdp/cdp.so&quot;
modparam(&quot;cdp&quot;, &quot;config_file&quot;, &quot;/opt/OpenIMSCore/ser_ims/cfg/pcscf.xml&quot;)
//to be customized with your pcscf.xml path
loadmodule &quot;/opt/OpenIMSCore/ser_ims/modules/cdp_avp/cdp_avp.so&quot;
modparam(&quot;pcscf&quot;,&quot;use_pcc&quot;,1)


modparam(&quot;pcscf&quot;,&quot;forced_qos_peer&quot;,&quot;pcrf.open-ims.test&quot;)
modparam(&quot;pcscf&quot;,&quot;qos_release7&quot;,1)

modparam(&quot;pcscf&quot;,&quot;ipv4_for_signaling&quot;,&quot;192.168.20.2&quot;) //to be customized
with your IP address to pcscf
modparam(&quot;pcscf&quot;,&quot;port_for_signaling&quot;,4060)

Then you might experience a bug with UCT IMS Policy Framework that would not
accept communication because of insufficient bandwidth (even if your policy
declares enough), I have reported the bug and how to fix it on the bug
declaration page of UCT IMS Client project.

Hope this will help, regards,

Didier

Hi there,

I have installed and successfully configured the OpenIMSCore, and the UCT
Policy Control Framework following the howto guide
&quot;<A HREF="http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/policy_control_howto.html">http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/policy_control_howto.html</A>&quot; which goes with
the updated ser_ims_qos (branch 12 as the branch 8 doesn't exist any more).

But I have the following problem : it seems that the SDP messages with
communication parameters are not transmitted to the PCRF for policy checking
(through the diameter requests).
According to the Step7 (Testing) of the tutorial, I should see in the PCRF
window a trace of these exchange if they occured : &quot;Examine the PCRF
terminal window - with  each exchange of SDP offer and answer a Diameter
request is sent to the PCRF&quot;.
But I don't have anything, which is confirmed by my analysis in wireshark,
where such diameter exchanges between P-CSCF and PCRF does not take place.

I am launching the PCSCF (192.168.20.2) on eth0 so that it can be reched
from other machine in my network, ICSCF(10.1.22.103), SCSCF(10.1.22.104) and
HSS(10.1.22.105) locally on virtual interface of the loopback.
PCRF(10.1.22.107) and PCEF(10.1.22.108) are also launched on virtual
interface of the loopback.

Basically PCSCF, ICSCF, SCSCF and HSS are running correctly, PCRF and PCEF
are also started correctly and their Rx and Gx interface are started.
All the launching logs of those entities are shown in the logs below :

====================================================
====================================================

I am using the pcscf.qos.cfg file with the 2 following line enables that
should enable usage of the Rx interface if I understood well :
modparam(&quot;pcscf&quot;,&quot;forced_qos_peer&quot;,&quot;pcrf.open-ims.test&quot;)
modparam(&quot;pcscf&quot;,&quot;qos_release7&quot;,1)

But when I connect a UCTIMSClient as Bob on a Remote machine, and as Alice
on the local machine with QoS Strength &quot;mandatory&quot;, type either &quot;end-to-end&quot;
or &quot;mandatory&quot; and access &quot;IEEE 802.11a&quot; and and making a call between them,
nothing happens at PCRF and PCEF level, the call is going well anyway, but
it didn't go throught QoS or policy decision !

I'have seen some post in this mailing list mentionning the activation of the
Rx interface or being in push mode for the P-CSCF, isn't it already well
configured in the pcscf.qos.cfg file provided with the uctpcrf1.0.2.tar.gz ?

If somebody could help me, I would appraciated as I'am searching what could
possibly be wrong for days now !


Regards,

Didier.
