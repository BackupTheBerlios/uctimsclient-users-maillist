<PRE>Hi Richard,
 
When I give the command &quot; ldd uctiptv&quot; it says libeXosip2.so.4 =&gt; not
found
 
But when I give &quot; locate libeXosip2.so.4&quot; it locates the file in
/usr/local/lib.
 
Am I untaring the libeXosip2 tar file in wrong place ? Pl direct as i am
having the tar.gz of the library file.
 
I am running Red Hat version of linux.
 
Thanks &amp; Regards,
Indranil

Hi Indranil

Can you run the ldd command on the binary created ? (i.e. ldd uctiptv )
?

You should get a list showing something like libeXosip2.so.4 =&gt;
/usr/lib/libeXosip2.so.4.

Where is it looking for the file ? What distribution are you running ?
Ubuntu places most things in /usr instead of /usr/local

Kind Regards
Richard Spiers
