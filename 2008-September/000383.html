<PRE>Hi Richard,
 
The other lib files are in /usr/lib. So I moved the libeXosip2.so.4 to
/usr/lib.
 
Now, I execute the following command :
 
./uctiptv 500000 1 /media/x.wmv
 
I get the following error:
 
Initialising 1 on channel 1
Starting channel 1
Elements created
Pipeline created
 
{&lt;unknown&gt;:4575}: GLib_GOBJECT- CRITICAL **:g_object_set:assertion
'G_IS_OBJECT(object)' failed.

{&lt;unknown&gt;:4575}: GStreamer - WARNING **: Trying to connect elements

{&lt;unknown&gt;:4575}: GStreamer - WARNING **: Trying to connect elements
that doesn't share a common ancester: ffmpegcolorspace ueuev
 
Elements Linked
If the server gets stuck at this point then there is an error ..perhaps
an incompatible input file.
 
 
Pl help on this.
 
Thanks &amp; Regards,
Indranil

Hi Indranil

What are the other lines of that command looking like - are they all in
/usr/local/lib ? I.e. something like libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 =&gt;
/usr/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0 ?

Kind Regards
Richard Spiers

	Hi Richard,
	 
	When I give the command &quot; ldd uctiptv&quot; it says libeXosip2.so.4
=&gt; not found
	 
	But when I give &quot; locate libeXosip2.so.4&quot; it locates the file in
/usr/local/lib.
	 
	Am I untaring the libeXosip2 tar file in wrong place ? Pl direct
as i am having the tar.gz of the library file.
	 
	I am running Red Hat version of linux.
	 
	Thanks &amp; Regards,
	Indranil

	Hi Indranil
	
	Can you run the ldd command on the binary created ? (i.e. ldd
uctiptv ) ?
	
	You should get a list showing something like libeXosip2.so.4 =&gt;
/usr/lib/libeXosip2.so.4.
	
	Where is it looking for the file ? What distribution are you
running ? Ubuntu places most things in /usr instead of /usr/local
	
	Kind Regards
	Richard Spiers
